Medical Image Interpretation Methods fot a Detailed Heart Health Analysis
======



Motivation and Objective 
======
Cardiovascular disease refers to numerous dysfunctions of the heart and the circulatory system. According to the latest available statistics from the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for approximately 17.7 million or 31% of all deaths worldwide. Maintaining and improving cardiovascular health is the main motivation for cardiovascular disease research. The development of advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can improve our understanding of disease physiology and serve as a monitor of disease
progression. The interpretation of the collected medical images depends heavily on computer processing methods. Image processing approaches have been
proposed to extract parameters of cardiac shape and function from different modalities of cardiac imaging, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis of the heart. Medical software is often very expensive and tied to the manufacturers of a particular device, making it difficult for smaller hospitals and researchers to obtain such software.

The main objective of this project is to develop new methods for the analysis of cardiovascular images, which will allow the determination of as many
cardiovascular quantifications of the heart as possible from as few images as possible, in order to obtain a complete analysis of cardiovascular health.

This analysis can be achieved by establishing causal relationships between specific quantifications and their demonstrated effects on cardiovascular health. Examples of quantifications that can be used are: cardiac geometry and volume, major artery geometry, left atrial morphology, blood flow through the aorta, cardiac compliance analysis, and epicardial fat quantification. Deviation from normal values of almost all of these quantifying factors is a risk for the development of some heart diseases. Timely detection of such deviations allows to identify potential risks to patients&#39; health, which is a fundamental improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
